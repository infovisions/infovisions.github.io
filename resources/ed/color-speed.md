# ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µðŸ”´ Speed-Limit Colors: 1-Hour Activity on Data + Color

Have you ever had people who think they have a strong intuition about color design, but wildly underestimate the challenging practice of mapping data to color? After years of teaching design and visualization, Iâ€™ve found that hindsight bias often nudges students to assume that color decisions donâ€™t need formal instruction, but could easily be guided by common-sense. To counteract these counterproductive feelings, I designed a hands-on activity to motivate the necessity of theory and knowledge in color design. In one hour, students gain first-hand experience in some of the challenges of color design, includingâ€¦
- Mathematical distances in some color spaces are not the same as perceptual distances
- Individual differences may disrupt the meanings we associate with colors
- Relying on intuition is likely to create inaccessible designs
- User testing is highly effective at providing quick, cheap tests against our own intuition


### Prompt
The state of Colorado has decided that the only way to alleviate traffic on busy interstates is to introduce variable speed limits that they can dynamically change depending on traffic conditions. The state does not have enough funding for numeric, digital speed limit signs. As a result, they are replacing speed limit signs with single LED lights. Your job is to translate any potential speed-limit from 0 to 100 to a unique color that is immediately understandable by drivers.
